HTML5 & Web Development 

This assignment demonstrates the use of fragment links and page content layout and positioning.

Review Chapter 3 in the textbook.

INSTRUCTIONS: Watch the class lecture. Similar to the demonstration in the lecture, recreate the Statue of Liberty Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty) as
follows:

1. Create the left bar (where you have the Wikipedia logo).

a. Replace the logo with a rounded image of the flag of your home country. Get help
with rounded images.

b. Include 10 random links subdivided into 3 categories similar to the Wikipedia page
layout.

2. Create the right-side box where it says "Statue of Liberty Liberty Enlightening the World".

a. This section should include an image and 10 relevant facts about the Statue of
Liberty.

3. Create the middle content area with 5 paragraphs sections.

a. Each paragraph is to include 3 sub-paragraph sections.

b. Each paragraph section is to have one image to the left side.

4. Create the content box with the page links (to be placed at the top left side of the main
content section).

a. Create fragment links to the 5-page sections/paragraphs and the 3 subsections/paragraphs. When clicked, each link should point to the specific paragraph
on the webpage.

b. Create Back to Top fragment links that point to the top section of the page.

c. Place the Back to Top fragment links below each paragraph section. When clicked,
the link should point to the top of the webpage.

5. Though Wikipedia has no banner, you are to place a banner at the top of the content area
(similar to the lecture demonstration).

a. Your banner is to include a relevant image of the Statue of Liberty.

6. Just below the 5
th paragraph section, create a table similar to enhance.html. Follow the
directions in TASK 2 of Lesson 4 Assignment (then go to Step 6 of Lesson3PROJECT.pdf).

a. This table should span the width of the content box 100%.

7. Just below the table in STEP 6, place another table similar to the purple one at the bottom of
the Wikipedia page (containing Statue of Liberty in the top row, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi
in the second row, National symbols of the United States in the third row and so on. You are
to create 5 rows with random links.

8. In the footer section, include the copyright symbol, your name, course and year.

9. Check all fragment links to be sure you can navigate across the webpage from top to bottom
successfully.
